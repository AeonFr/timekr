    <p>This App can keep a score of the total time you spent in a project.</p>
    <p>
      Acording to the Pomodoro technique, 25 minutes is the optimal time concentration and
      focus can be kept, so the Pomodoro timer incorporated in each project will count down from
      25 minutes to zero, after that it will beep multiple times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time spent in each project will be commited either when the timer reaches zero, or by
      using the "Insert time manually" function.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the commit history of each project,
      you can see when and how much time you added to that project.
    </p>
